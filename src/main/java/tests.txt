for the cfg we want to test its robustness in the following way:

    robustness of the syntax checker by changing prebuild sentences:
        deleting
        inserting
        swapping


    testing different kinds of edit distance
        minimum
        damerau-levenstein
        hamming distance
        jaro distance
        qwerty distance


for the Facial scanner we want to try and see the effects of
    certain kinds of noise
        gaussian
        periodic
        salt and pepper
        film grain 
        anisotropic
        read noise
        sensor heat
    changing channel value:
        saturation
        luminocity
    equalizing channel values:
        saturation
        luminocity

lastly writing the report
