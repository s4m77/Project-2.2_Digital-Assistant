for the cfg we want to test its robustness in the following way:

    robustness of the syntax checker by changing prebuild sentences:
        deleting - user omitting a character
        inserting - user adding a character twice
        swapping - user swapping two characters close to each other


    testing different kinds of edit distance
        damerau-levenstein (modified minimum edit distance)
        jaro distance
        qwerty distance
        cosine distance


for the Facial scanner we want to try and see the effects of
    certain kinds of noise
        gaussian : stdev mean 
        periodic : amplitude frequency
        salt and pepper : percentage
        film grain : 
        anisotropic :
        read noise
        sensor heat
    changing channel value:
        saturation
        luminocity
    equalizing channel values:
        saturation
        luminocity

lastly writing the report
